            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>What discussion points did you participated on in the unitâ€™s discussion board for
        Assignment 1? If you did not participate, state your reason.</strong>

                I did not use the discussion board because I had no problem with anything. However i used other platforms like w3school and yt for clearing my doubts.
